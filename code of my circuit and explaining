 * The code of the servo
 * This code is written to control the position of the RC cleaner
 * Since I don't know how to use the remote controlled yet, I used
 * button instead.
 * From my desigh, when you push the left button, the servo will 
 * trun to the left and when you push the right button, 
 * the servo will trun to the right.
